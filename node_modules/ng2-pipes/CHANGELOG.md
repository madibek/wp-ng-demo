# [2.0.0](https://github.com/danrevah/ngx-pipes/compare/v1.6.6...v2.0.0) (2017-11-08)


* improve package bundling (#84) ([6a6f8ca](https://github.com/danrevah/ngx-pipes/commit/6a6f8ca))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* we do not publish the source file of each pipe now. As with webpack/rollup's treeshaking feature, we don't need to publish pipes separately. User who used to reference to source pipes directly should update their paths.
